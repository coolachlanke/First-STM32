# My First STM32 Project

Simple PCB with minimum circuit plus SWD, USART, I2C and USB. Designed wholly in KiCAD 9.

Take a look a the fully sick render:

..and now take a look at the fully sick assembled board:

The board's indicator LEDs are both on. Green indicates the 3V3 bus is live and the orange is a result of the 'blinky' sketch the MCU is running being in the HIGH state.
